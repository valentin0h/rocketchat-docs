# Offline Workspace Registration

After deploying your air-gapped workspace successfully, navigate to your workspace URL and continue with the following steps to register your workspace on [Rocket.Chat Cloud](https://cloud.rocket.chat/):

* Complete the **Admin and Organization Information** steps in the [rocket.chat-setup-wizard.md](../accessing-your-workspace/rocket.chat-setup-wizard.md "mention").
* Click the **Register Offline** button. It displays a **token** with some instructions to paste it in [Rocket.Chat Cloud](https://cloud.rocket.chat/).

* Go to your [Rocket.Chat Cloud](https://cloud.rocket.chat/) account. Navigate to **Workspaces** and click **Register self-managed**. Click the **Continue Offline** button and paste the **token** displayed earlier from your workspace setup wizard.
* Click **Continue.** Another **code** is generated on Rocket.Chat Cloud to finalize your workspace registration. Copy that code and click **Continue.**
* Go back to the **Register Offline** screen on your workspace **Setup Wizard** where the initial token was generated, agree to the [**Terms**](broken-reference/) and [**Privacy Policy**](broken-reference/)**,** then click **Next.**
* Paste the code generated from [Rocket.Chat Cloud](https://cloud.rocket.chat/) and click **Complete Registration**.

Once you've completed these steps, your workspace will be set up and ready to use. You can access it by logging in with your admin credentials. You can always update your setup information in **Workspace Administration** [setup-wizard.md](../../use-rocket.chat/omnichannel/workspace-administration/settings/setup-wizard.md "mention").

{% hint style="info" %}
For workspaces that accessible through the internet, kindly visit [setup-wizard.md](../../use-rocket.chat/omnichannel/workspace-administration/settings/setup-wizard.md "mention") to set up your workspace.
{% endhint %}
