# Subscription

The Subscription dashboard provides an overview of all workspace subscriptions, including [plan](../../../readme/our-plans.md), disrupted services, seats, and active contacts, and allows workspace administrators to manage them.

To access this menu, go to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Subscription.**

It highlights your current workspace [**plan** ](../../../readme/our-plans.md)and its offerings. You can easily view the total **seats** and **monthly active contacts** subscribed to your workspace, as well as the amount used and remaining.

Click **Monthly Active Contacts > Buy More** to purchase more MAC packs. Visit the official Monthly Active Contacts documentation to learn more about MACs.

Click **Sync license updates** to sync your workspace to Rocket.Chat Cloud and fetch any updates required.

Click **Manage Subscription** to contact our Sales team and discuss your subscriptions.
