The Rocket.Chat engagement dashboard gives you great insights into users, messages, and channel activities.

To access this menu, navigate to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Engagement.**

The engagement dashboard has different sections for **Users**, **Messages,** and **Channels**.

You can download the data for any matrix in CSV using the download button at the top left.

## User

From the **Users** tab, you can view the following metrics:

* **New users**: It displays the total number of new users for a select period. You can also see the number by which users increased/decreased from the last interval of the selected period.
* **Active users**: It displays the total number of users using the application daily, weekly, and monthly.
* **Users by the time of day**: It displays the total number of users by time of the day for a selected period. The darker the color of the brick, the more users are online at that time. You can also check the exact count of users for an hour by hovering over the mouse cursor on the respective brick.
* **When is the chat busier?**: It displays the time by day or hour when your chat is busier.

## Messages

From the **Messages** tab, you can view the following metrics:

* **Messages Sent**: It displays the total number of messages sent for a select period. You can also see the number by which the sent message count increased/decreased from the last interval of a select period.
* **Where are the messages being sent?**: For a selected period, it shows the top five most popular public, private, and private channels where the most messages are being sent.

## Channels

For a selected period, this table shows the total number of messages sent across all of your channels, along with the increase or decrease in that number from the previous interval.
