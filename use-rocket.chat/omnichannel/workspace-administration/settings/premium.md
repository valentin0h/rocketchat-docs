# Premium

In certain scenarios, you may need to update your workspace license manually. This is typically not required if your workspace is registered and the license is provided by Rocket.Chat Cloud.

Navigate to **`Administration > Workspace > Settings > Premium`** to access the license update settings.

* **Premium License**: Enter your workspace's license key here.
* **Status**: Displays the current status of your license, indicating whether it is valid or not.
* **Saving Changes**: After making any modifications, ensure to click the 'Save changes' button to apply them.

If your workspace is registered and the license is provided by Rocket.Chat Cloud, you don't need to update the license here manually. For detailed guidance on [apply for your workspace license](../../../../setup-and-configure/license-application.md#i-have-a-self-managed-registered-workspace), consult the official Rocket.Chat documentation.
