{% hint style="danger" %}
We recommend these settings be altered only with the guidance of the Rocket.Chat Development or Support Teams. Do not touch them if you don't know what you are doing!
{% endhint %}

* **Disable Notifications**: This setting completely disables the notifications system. When enabled, sounds, desktop notifications, mobile notifications, and email notifications immediately stopped.
* **Disable Presence Broadcast**: This setting prevents all instances from sending the status changes of the users to their clients, keeping all the users with their presence status from the first load.
* **Disable Instance Broadcast**: Setting this to true prevents the Rocket.Chat instances from sending events to the other instances. It may cause syncing problems and misbehavior.
* **Disable Sessions Monitor**: This setting stops the processing of user sessions, causing the statistics to stop working correctly.
* **Disable Live Chat Activity Monitor**: Activating this setting stops the processing of Live Chat contacts sessions, causing the statistics to stop working correctly.
* **Disable Statistics Generator**: This lets you stop the processing of all statistics making the info page outdated until someone clicks on the refresh button and may cause other missing information around the system.
* **Disable Data Exporter Processor**: This setting stops the processing of all export requests from users, so they will not receive the link to download their data.
* **Disable Workspace Sync**: Enabling this option disables the workspace sync with Rocket.Chat Cloud, which may cause issues with the marketplace and premium [licenses](../../../../setup-and-configure/license-application.md).
