# Federation

Federation allows for an unlimited number of workspaces to communicate with each other. Federating a workspace makes it visible to other workspaces over the federated network, thus making communication with other federation-enabled servers possible. It offers a great way to collaborate with partners, customers, and other organizations, regardless of which chat platform they use.

Rocket.Chat provides Federation using the [Matrix Protocol](https://matrix.org/) by default.

To access Federation on your workspace,

* Navigate to **Administration > Workspace > Settings > Federation.**
* [**Matrix Bridge**](matrix-bridge/)**:** See how to federate your Rocket.Chat workspace with the [Matrix Protocol](https://matrix.org/).
