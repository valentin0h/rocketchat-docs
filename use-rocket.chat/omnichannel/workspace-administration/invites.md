# Invites

Here, you can view and delete the invite links generated to invite users to the team or channels.

To access this menu,

Navigate to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Invites**.

{% hint style="info" %}
To create an invite link, see [#send-an-invite-link](../../user-guides/rooms/discussions/manage-discussion-members.md#send-an-invite-link "mention").
{% endhint %}

## Delete a record

If you want to delete any of these invite records:

* Click the **cancel** button next to it.
* Hit **Yes** to confirm the deletion.

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is handy when you have an invite link with an **Expiration** **date: Never**. To prevent abuse, you can revoke the invite link by deleting its record.
{% endhint %}
