# Threads

**Threads** help to organize conversations and enable users to discuss topics without disorganizing a [room](../). They improve the ability to process room content, find, follow, and resume conversations more efficiently, keeping threaded discussions focused. Threads are a series of replies or follow-up conversations under any message in a [Team](../teams/), [Channels](../channels/), [Discussion](../../../omnichannel/workspace-administration/settings/discussion.md), or [Direct Message](../../../omnichannel/workspace-administration/settings/discussion.md). They are identified by: <img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/thread-icon.png" alt="" data-size="line">

## View Threads in a Room

To view the list of all threads in a room, click the **thread icon** in that room header.

## Expand and Follow a Thread

Since threads appear by the side of any room it was created in, you can expand the thread to occupy much space.

To **expand** a thread,

* Click on the <img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/thread-expand-icon.png" alt="" data-size="line">**expand icon** on the thread header.

To **collapse** a thread,

* Click the <img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/thread-collapse-icon.png" alt="" data-size="line">**collapse icon** on the thread header.

## Following a Thread

You can follow and unfollow threads to get notifications on any messages sent under that thread. By default, you automatically follow any thread you belong to.

To **follow** or **unfollow** a thread,

* Click on the <img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/bell-icon.png" alt="" data-size="line">**bell icon** on the thread header.
