## Linking Trello Board to Rocket.Chat Channel

After configuring the Trello App, link your Trello boards for monitoring in any Rocket.Chat channel of your choice.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can only link Trello boards to [channels](../../../../use-rocket.chat/user-guides/rooms/channels/). Other [rooms](../../../../use-rocket.chat/omnichannel/workspace-administration/rooms.md) are not supported.
{% endhint %}

To link your Trello board to a channel,

* Navigate to the channel where you want to receive your Trello board notifications.
* Run the slash command `/trello link` to link a Trello board. A list of Trello boards linked to your account is displayed. Select a board and click **Link** to connect that board to the channel.
* After linking, you receive notifications in the channel for any activity on that Trello board.
* To view the card on your Trello board, click the **Go to card** button on the notification message.
